Estimate appropriate force and directionality for each thruster for the quad to reach a position and orientation
- as opposed to setting individual targets for each thruster: simply doesn't work

Should be able to rotate position without moving the quad, simplifies the structure. Get this working, then factor position back in.

Determine total force required to moved object to a position and to rotate to a position

calculate force vectors needed to reach rotation and position: acceleration in the x, y, z and angular acceleration about the x, y, z axes
 -> divide vector to sub positional force to reach rotation and position: force split across 4 different thrust vectors
 -> divide vector to provide individual directionality and force separately: force split into angular direction in the x and y, then force in the z

 mass = 0.04kg - without integrating surface, guess 0.01kg for where it matters
 radius = 9.75cm = 0.0975m

 kv = rpm per volt: 12* 2500 = 30000 rpm

 inertia = mass * r^2 = 0.00038025  | 0.0000950625
 angular velocity: 30,000 rpm = 3141.59265 rads/second     |     5000rpm = 523.59877
 Angular momentum = inertia * angular velocity = 1.19459 kgm^2 / sec   |   0.29864765	|	0.04977

 torque = 60 rad/s * 1.19459

 torque = 1.0472 rad/s * 0.2986476 = 17.9188 kg/m * 9.81 = 175.723 ozin MAX -> 0.31724/3.11212 nm
 torque = 1.0472 rad/s * 0.0497746 =  2.9865 kg/m * 9.81 =  29.287 ozin MIN -> 0.05212/0.51134 nm

 torque = swiveling rate * angular momentum

 Count in gyroscopic precession

 Twisting an arm induces torque on the quad itself, rotating the quadcopter relative to the ground
 - relative to the quad the arm is being twisted to the specified angle

 X Transitions to multiple angles. For instance (45, 90, 0) instead of (45, 0, 0)

 X Rotation matrix about Y axis only for thrusters to modify which relative direction it should be providing thrust
 -Moving to a position on one axis while at the original rotation can be done through moving only one joint
 -Moving to a position on one axis while at a different rotation about the Y axis is done through moving two joints
 -Modify thrust vector computation
