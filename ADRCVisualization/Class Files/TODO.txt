Estimate appropriate force and directionality for each thruster for the quad to reach a position and orientation
- as opposed to setting individual targets for each thruster: simply doesn't work

Should be able to rotate position without moving the quad, simplifies the structure. Get this working, then factor position back in.

Determine total force required to moved object to a position and to rotate to a position

calculate force vectors needed to reach rotation and position: acceleration in the x, y, z and angular acceleration about the x, y, z axes
 -> divide vector to sub positional force to reach rotation and position: force split across 4 different thrust vectors
 -> divide vector to provide individual directionality and force separately: force split into angular direction in the x and y, then force in the z
